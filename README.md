    Bring tranquility to your UI - An open-source React UI component library for building custom components with simplicity in mind.

## Why not just use Radix-UI/ShadCN?

Libraries like Radix-UI or ShadCN provide headless component primitives that work well with any React tech stack.

Tranq-UI aims to provide already pre-configured components based on those libraries that support Tailwind + Framer motion + ClassVarianceAuthority out-of-the-box allowing developers to skip the boilerplate part of the implementation. **Additionally, Tranq-UI provides opinionated UI patterns that can be reused across different projects.**

## Philiosophy

This library is aligned with the philosophy of the Radix-UI library.

[See Radix-UI philosophy](https://github.com/radix-ui/primitives/blob/main/philosophy.md).

## Usage

Each component is self-contained. One can copy and paste a source code of the component into their project with all functionalities\*.

_\*Some heavily re-used definitions are moved to the [shared](./primitives/packages/react/shared) directory. They need to be copied separately._

---

Sidenote: Currently, Tranq-UI is a personal, experimental UI library that allows [author](https://github.com/letelete) to maintain a library of reusable components they can share across different projects.
